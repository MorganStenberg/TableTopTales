# ** TableTopTales API **

TabletopTales is a social media site for board games enthusiasts, targeted towards people who love to play board games and want to share their reviews for others! As well as finding new games to add to their wishlist of games they want to play. 

On TableTopTales users can write their own review of a game, create games to add to their whishlist, connect those games to an existing review, like and comment on other reviews. 

The app is built in two parts with this making up the backend API and the front end is built with React.js.
